# ITSM Ticket Management Tool

A web-based IT Service Management (ITSM) application designed to streamline the creation, tracking, and resolution of IT support tickets. Built with Python, Flask, SQLite, and HTML, this tool simulates real-world helpdesk workflows, making it ideal for managing IT incidents and user support requests.

## Features
- **Ticket Management**: Create, edit, search, and track tickets with attributes like title, description, priority (High, Medium, Low), and status (Open, In Progress, Resolved).
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with role-based access control (admin and readonly roles) using hashed passwords.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage users (add/remove) and update ticket details, while readonly users can view tickets.
- **Ticket Search**: Search tickets by title for quick access to relevant issues.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays ticket priority and status distributions (via `/get_chart_data` endpoint, compatible with Chart.js).
- **Responsive UI**: Built with HTML and Jinja2 templates for a user-friendly interface, suitable for support staff.

## Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, HTML, JavaScript, SQL
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Database**: SQLite (lightweight, serverless database)
- **Security**: Werkzeug for password hashing and secure authentication
- **Templating**: Jinja2 for dynamic HTML rendering
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap (implied for responsive design)
- **Version Control**: Git, hosted on GitHub

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaiswaranil8387/itsm-ticket-management.git
   cd itsm-ticket-management
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask werkzeug
   ```
3. **Initialize the Database**:
   - The application automatically creates a `tickets.db` SQLite database with sample tickets and a default admin user (username: `admin`, password: `admin123`) on first run.
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
   - Log in with the default admin credentials or create new users via the admin dashboard.

## Usage
- **Login**: Use the default admin credentials (username: `admin`, password: `admin123`) or create a new user.
- **Create Tickets**: Admins can add tickets via the "Create Ticket" tab, specifying title, description, and priority.
- **Manage Tickets**: Update ticket status (Open, In Progress, Resolved) or edit ticket details from the ticket list.
- **Search Tickets**: Use the search bar to find tickets by title.
- **Manage Users**: Admins can add or remove users via the "Manage Users" tab.
- **View Analytics**: Check ticket priority and status distributions (requires Chart.js integration for visualization).
